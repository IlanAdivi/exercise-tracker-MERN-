# exercise-tracker-MERN-

https://ilan-adivi-exercise-tracker.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
On this project, I developed an exercise-tracker app that allows the user to register for the exercise, and then he will receive an SMS that he has registered.

As part of the project, I used in Amazon AWS-S3 for store the photos of the users, and also in Twilio to send an SMS from the server to the client.

Technologies: MongoDB, Express, React(&Redux), Node.js.
